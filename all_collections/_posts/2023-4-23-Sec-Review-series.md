title: "h3ll Sec Review series"
---

So, once again, I've been absent for a long time - tough months, I'll not lie. But I've thought about something that maybe could cheer this feed up once again: I call it *hSRs* - _h3ll Sec Review series_. 

I'll be adding some posts about some subjects related to Sec, as a good reminder or review for some aspects of our (Sec) daily activities - from basic concepts up to advanced stuff that I may be developing. I really hope this works and that it can be useful to someone at some point. :)

Right now, I'd really like to commit to a biweekly-monthly time window, and I hope it doesn't exceed that. I'm planning to begin it shortly, I have even thought about the first post, but I'll leave this for later. 

That's it! :P
