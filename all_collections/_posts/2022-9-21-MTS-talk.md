title: "My Mind The Sec 2022 session: 'The Dark Side of Bug Bounty'"
---

So, really busy week. Apart from tens of personal issues to solve and work-related activities, I had a session at [Mind The Sec 2022](https://www.mindthesec.com.br/) yesterday, where I talked about the importance of Bug Bounty programs under a corporate view - as the session name says: _'The Dark Side of Bug Bounty: the perspective of who pays the bill!'_. 

Had some nice attendance, waiting for an overall release of presentations so I can make this one available over here, but the main idea was presenting the potentialities of investing in BB programs when compared to money losses on data breaches - some real cases were presented, like last week's Uber thing. Really hope to have contributed positively to the area.
