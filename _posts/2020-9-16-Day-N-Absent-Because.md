title: Day N of 100 - I've been absent, but there is a good reason.
---

Hi, guys! First of all, I would like to apologize ONCE AGAIN for being so absent from posting; in fact, it has been almost A WHOLE YEAR since my last post over here. 

During the final days of 2019, I worked on my eBook and my video material for the Forensic Analysis in Linux Systems class I am teaching in a graduate course here in Brazil, as I said before, and since February/March 2020 I have been involved in a Python Development Project - working independently in all my "spare time". Since I am almost finishing the mentioned project, I am thinking about describing it a little bit here (without being too descriptive due to a signed NDA :P) or keep posting the 100 Days Of Code Challenge, or even posting freely at it should be.

My main plans for the next days are: talking about the Forensic Analysis material, talking about the software I've been developing (believe me: it is pretty interesting!) and, after that, we could go back to our main plan and start talking about general _"hacking"_ stuff - even finishing my first Google Hacking post. 

So, that's it. Thanks for your patience and attention and keep hacking the world. ðŸ˜‰
